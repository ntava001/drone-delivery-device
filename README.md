# Drone Delivery Device

One of the biggest problems with a drone delivery system is maneuverability around a crowded residential area. Currently, drones need to land in an open area, but that can be problematic in less spacious areas. Most residences have obstacles such as trees, power lines, and light posts that can impede the droneâ€™s ability to land. Thus, our design solution for this problem is to build an 18 foot tall system that clears most obstacles, safely catching a package dropped by a hovering drone, without the drone landing, and to transporting the package to a more accessible area for the consumer to pick up.
