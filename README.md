# Drone Delivery Device

A drone delivery device able to obtain and distribute a package for the consumer


## Introduction
One of the biggest problems with a drone delivery system is maneuverability around a crowded residential area. Currently, drones need to land in an open area, but that can be problematic in less spacious areas. Most residences have obstacles such as trees, power lines, and light posts that can impede the droneâ€™s ability to land. Thus, my team and I's design solution for this problem is to build an 18 foot tall system that clears most obstacles, safely catching a package dropped by a hovering drone, without the drone landing, and to transporting the package to a more accessible area for the consumer to pick up.

The Virtual and Physical Prototype of our design operate roughly the same way. The virtual prototype is used to show how our design would look like using a full scale model. It illustrates the design of the device with respect to a house, includes the padding used to catch the package as well as the sensor that detects it. The physical model is very scaled down and dictates how our device will operate in real life. The physical prototype looks more at the electrical components used to drive the motor, allowing us to create the intended design.
